### Activity 1

Get started on the minigame as soon as possible, don't procrastinate

### Activity 2
 - 10
 - 2
 - prints "hello world" in the console every frame.
 - Update and debug logs are usable in Monobehavior. ??? should be replaced with Monobehavior.
 - "x = 10" is printed
 - The highlighted areas are the arguments/parameters. 10 is passed into the method
 - In line 5, it should be _playerTransform.Translate(_direction) because Transform is already defined
 - Change Transform to _playerTransform

### Activity 2

In this push, I created all the needed objects within the game and created a fully functioning jump mechanic in the PLayer script. I need to figure out how to make the coins randomly spawn and move across the screen, while also updating UI text everytime the player collides with a coin. They need to be destroyed when they go off the screen as well.

## Week 4 In-class activity

### Activity 0:

When multiple Locator objects are added to the scene, only one is kept because it is a singleton.

## Week 5 In-class activity

### Activity 1: 

I honestly think the design of the interfaces and abstract classes are a bit confusing to me, I feel like interfaces are for much more unrelated objects and defined while abstract classes use shared behaviour. 

### Activity 2:

The InventoryUI is the view. The PlayerW5Demo2 is the controller. The EnemyStats and ItemW5Demo2 classes are the model.

### Activity 3:

Scenario 1: The project includes inheritance and polymorphism that might have the buttons as a parent class, and the different buttons that add separate points as child classes. As a FSM, different button types can change the state depending on the button that's instantiated. This can track whether the player needs to hit a combo, click or hold down on the buttons that could change the amount of points received.

### Activity 4:

[GDIM 32 Highly Entropic Beings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IXMcedZDubU3jHOIg-ZRwtj0N-xMFaV7MpOOSQTA65Q/edit?tab=t.0) 

## Week 6 In-class activity

### Activity 1:

Notes: We can use the profiler (Window -> Analysis -> Profiler) to check what methods are executing and look at how long it's taking said  method's to execute. Additionally, there's no need for a polygon collider if our game has a lot of detail. Locator makes it easier to reference a single component such as the player, so there aren't as many references in other classes, and no need for GetComponent as much.

### Activity 2:

Attendance: Marcelo Tolosa, Nathan Hernandez
